# Element Properties Lookup Tool
This Python code provides a user-friendly tool for looking up properties of chemical elements. The tool is designed to be simple and easy to use, making it suitable for students, educators, and researchers who need quick access to elemental properties.

# Getting Started
To use this code, you need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. You can download Python 3 from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Once you have installed Python, you can download or clone the code repository to your computer. The code is contained in a single file called ElementsData.py.

To run the code, open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the ElementsData.py file is located. Then type the following command:


```bash
  python ElementsData.py
```
This will start the code and display a prompt asking you to enter the name of an element.

# Using the Code
The Element Properties Lookup Tool is designed to be easy to use. Once you have started the code, simply enter the name of an element and press enter. The code will search for the element in its database and return its properties, including:

• The symbol of the element

• The atomic number of the element

• The atomic mass of the element

• The electronic configuration of the element

• If the element you entered is not in the database, the code will display an error message.

In addition to looking up individual elements, the code also provides an option to display a full list of all the elements in its database. To display the full list, simply type "Y" when prompted.

# Disclaimer
This code is based on the periodic table as of 2022, and it may not include newer or recently discovered elements. The electronic configurations provided in the code may not be the most updated or accurate for all elements. The user is responsible for verifying the accuracy and completeness of the information provided by the code.
